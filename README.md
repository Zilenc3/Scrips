# Scripts
Just some fun scripts to make my life easier.

#changeTerminal.sh (XFCE4 Only)
Using sgerrands repo for xfce solarized colors I made a script to allow me to easily switch between the two colour schemes solarized-light and solarized-dark

#changeHexchat.sh 
Using the Hexchat theme git page, I took solarized-light and solarized-dark and made a script to easily switch between the two.
